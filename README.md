# CS 4750 Final Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.6.

## To Run

To run this project locally, you must first build and serve the back end server of the project by running 'npm run dev:ssr' which will build and serve the back end. In a separate terminal, you must run 'npm start' after the backend server has finished and displayed "Node Express server listening on http://localhost:{port}". Once this is complete you will be able to navigate to the 'http://localhost:{port}' provided by running the front end. This will allow for the project to work and the frontend to make backend calls to our project's PostgreSQL database.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
